# Early-Prediction-of-Type-2-Diabetes
This project includes a machine learning pipeline to predict the progression of Type-2 Diabetes (T2D) using publicly available clinical and survey datasets. The goal is to provide an early-warning system that identifies high-risk patients, allowing for timely interventions and improved disease management.
